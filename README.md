# NLP-Emotion-Detection-From-Text-
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect emotions from textual data
Overview:
     Emotion detection from text is about understanding the feelings or emotions expressed in written words. It is useful in areas like customer feedback, social media analysis, and mental health support.

This project focuses on creating a system that can identify emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and fear in text. By using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), the system will analyze text and classify the emotions it contains.

Dataset information:
        
The Emotion Dataset is a labeled dataset designed for sentiment analysis and emotion detection tasks in natural language processing (NLP). It contains two columns:

1.Text: Sentences or phrases representing various contexts and topics.

2.Emotion: Emotion labels corresponding to the primary emotion expressed in the text (e.g.joy, angry, fear, etc.).
Project Workflow:
Imported the necessary libraries ,Data Exploration and Preprocessing, Fearure Extraction ,splited the data into training data and testing data.

Model Development:
        Implemented various machine learning algorithms:

        1.Naive Bayas Model
        2.xgboost Model
        3.Logistic Regression Model
        4.Random Forest
        5.Artificial Nural Network

Model Evaluation:
    Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Visualization
    
Technologies Used:
 programing language-Python
 Libraries-Pandas,NumPy(Data manipulation and analysis)
 Visualization-Matplotlib, Seaborn
 Scikit-learn: Machine learning and evaluation metrics.

 Conclusion:
     
In this project, we successfully built a model to detect emotions from text, such as joy, anger, sadness, and fear. By using techniques like data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning, the Random Forest model achieved good accuracy(accuracy score:0.9469). This work highlights the potential of NLP in understanding human emotions from text, which can be useful in areas like customer feedback analysis, mental health support, and social media monitoring
